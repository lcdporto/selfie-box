# SelfieBox #

Selfie Box is a Raspberry PI controlled lightbox to take pictures of objects, tools, ... whatever, that we have lying around in our Lab. The purpose of those pictures is to create an easy way to identify something and put it back in its place, keeping the lab organized.

Selfie Box is part of a larger project, called Boxing.
